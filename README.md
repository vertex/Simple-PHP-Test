NOTES
================================

A simple PHP Test I did.  Objective was to submit a form, return feedback, using any way I wanted.  I took advantage of Limonade's routing, and simple MVC.  It ended up being very lightweight and accomplished the goal greatly.

INSTALLATION
================================
mkdir lib
wget -O limonade.zip https://github.com/sofadesign/limonade/zipball/master
unzip limonade.zip
mv sofadesign-limonade-0d357db/lib lib/limonade
rm -rf sofadesign-limonade-0d357db
rm limonade.zip
